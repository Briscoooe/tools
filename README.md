# Tools
This is a collection of tools I find myself needing often. The motivation for this project is to not have to trust or depend on any online service, particularly string manipulation tools which may contain sensitive data.

The entire project is completely static using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There is no frameworks or build process and there is no network activity. The only third-party dependency is [turretcss](https://turretcss.com//) for accessibility and responsive design.
