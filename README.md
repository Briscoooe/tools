# Tools
This is a collection of tools I find myself needing often. The motivation for this project is to not have to trust or depend on any online service, particularly string manipulation tools on data which may be sensitive.

The project is 100% dependency free. It is completely static using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There is no frameworks or build process and there is no network activity.
